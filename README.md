**Project:-** AI Training Data Management System  
  
**Overview of the project**  
To train AI models, our customer, an AI developer, uses web scraping to gather publicly accessible data. But they have two major obstacles to overcome:  
**1. Keeping Questions and solutions Separate:-** Before developers receive the solutions, they should be able to evaluate their understanding by responding to questions. This facilitates learning and self-affirmation.  
**2. Maintaining Fair and Balanced Data:-** To produce AI models that are accurate and fair, the training data must be varied and devoid of bias.  
  
**Assumptions**  
1. Well organised data should reduce the data searching time.  
2. With the delay access to answers developers have a chance to check their knowledge.  
3. Tags should boost the search efficiency.  
4. AI models perform better with unbiased training data.  
5. Real-time bias reporting leads to quicker dataset improvements.  
6. Compliance with GDPR and CCPA ensures ethical and legal AI development.  
  
**Functional Requirements**  
1. As a developer, I want system can automatically arrange the questions so that I can easily find the relevant data for training.  
2. As a developer, I want system can stored the questions and answers separately so that I can test my knowledge before checking the answer.   
3. As a developer, I want questions to be labelled with tags so that I can easily filter and find the training material as per of my needs.  
4. As a developer, I want system to detect the bias and rebalance the data so that AI models can be trained on fair and diverse data.  
5. As a developer, I want instant reporting on biased dataset so that I can improving the training quality.  
6. As a developer, I want system to comply with legal guidelines so that I can use the training data legally and ethically.  
  
**System Requirements**  
1. The system should maintain the questions indexed structure for efficient information.  
2. Answers should be shown after the usersâ€™ confirmation.  
3. The system should allow tagging based on topics and difficulties.  
4. Bias reports must be produced on a regular basis for user evaluation.  
5. Alerts should be notified to users when biased and imbalanced data will occur.  
6. Unauthorized data access should be prevented by access control.  
  
**Validations**  
1. Does automatic categorization help developers to find training data quickly?  
2. Does delay access of answers actually improve learning?  
3. Are tags make it easier to search questions as compared to untagged data?  
4. Are AI models do better while training with rebalanced data?  
5. Are the bias reports easy to understand and useful for making corrections?  
6. Are access control measures effectively preventing unauthorized use?
