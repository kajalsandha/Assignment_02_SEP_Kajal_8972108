**Project:-** AI Training Data Management System  
  
**Overview of the project**  
To train AI models, our customer, an AI developer, uses web scraping to gather publicly accessible data. But they have two major obstacles to overcome:  
**1. Keeping Questions and solutions Separate:-** Before developers receive the solutions, they should be able to evaluate their understanding by responding to questions. This facilitates learning and self-affirmation.  
**2. Maintaining Fair and Balanced Data:-** To produce AI models that are accurate and fair, the training data must be varied and devoid of bias.  
  
**User Stories**  
1. As a developer, I want system can automatically arrange the questions so that I can easily find the relevant data for training.  
2. As a developer, I want system can stored the questions and answers separately so that I can test my knowledge before checking the answer.   
3. As a developer, I want questions to be labelled with tags so that I can easily filter and find the training material as per of my needs.  
4. As a developer, I want system to detect the bias and rebalance the data so that AI models can be trained on fair and diverse data.  
5. As a developer, I want instant reporting on biased dataset so that I can improving the training quality.  
6. As a developer, I want system to comply with legal guidelines so that I can use the training data legally and ethically.
